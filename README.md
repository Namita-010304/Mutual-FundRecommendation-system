Project Title: Mutual Fund Analytics & Recommendation System
Description:
Built a Python-based system to analyze and compare mutual funds using historical NAV data, risk ratios, and fund performance indicators. Used Pandas and NumPy for data handling and analysis, and implemented logic to filter funds based on user-defined criteria (e.g., time period, risk type, returns). Focused on clean code, user-friendly design, and performance. Also explored integrating basic natural language commands to improve user interaction (e.g., understanding "show top 5 SIP funds for 3 years"). This project reflects my interest in AI, NLP, and scalable solutions, and demonstrates strong Python skills, algorithmic thinking, and self-motivation.

Skills Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data structures & logical filtering

Exploratory NLP (rule-based commands)

Attention to clean, scalable code

Curiosity-driven project aligned with finance and AIProject Title: Mutual Fund Analytics & Recommendation System
